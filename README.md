# Portfolio

# Description
How to start a basic portofolio using HTML and CSS. We use HTML to link or attach logo and icons to a certain function ot button to make something appear in front of the screen.
The CSS we use for this porjects was creating flex box to fit certain images or links in correct location. We use media screen to make sure every person launching my website
 would be able to launch without having the wrong proportions display in front of the screen.
